There are several ways to host a web application on AWS, depending on the specific requirements of the application, the level of control and customization needed, and the budget and resources available. Here are some common options:

### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): 
With EC2, you can provision virtual servers in the cloud and install your own software and applications on them. This gives you full control over the server environment, but requires more management and maintenance compared to other options.

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk: 
Elastic Beanstalk is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering that allows you to deploy web applications and automatically handles the underlying infrastructure, such as load balancing, scaling, and monitoring. This makes it easier to deploy and manage applications, but with less control and customization compared to EC2.

### AWS Lambda: 
Lambda is a serverless computing platform that allows you to run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. It's well-suited for applications with sporadic or unpredictable traffic, but has limitations on the type and duration of code that can be run.

### AWS Fargate: 
Fargate is a container platform that allows you to run Docker containers in the cloud without managing the underlying infrastructure. It provides more control and customization than Lambda, but requires more setup and configuration compared to Elastic Beanstalk.

### Amazon Lightsail: 
Lightsail is a simplified cloud hosting service that provides pre-configured virtual private servers (VPS) and applications for common use cases, such as WordPress, Drupal, and Magento. It's designed for users who want a simple and low-cost option without the need for advanced customization or scalability.

### Amazon S3 and CloudFront
One of the best ways to host a static website developed with React on AWS is to use Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront.
