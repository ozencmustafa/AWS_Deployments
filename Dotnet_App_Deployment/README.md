Deploying on Elastic Beanstalk: Elastic Beanstalk is a fully-managed service that automates the deployment of your .NET applications. 
You can easily deploy web applications, worker services, and other .NET-based services to Beanstalk. It supports popular .NET frameworks, such as ASP.NET, 
.NET Core, and others. Beanstalk takes care of provisioning, scaling, and managing the underlying infrastructure, so you can focus on your application code.
