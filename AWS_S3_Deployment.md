One of the most cost-effective ways to host a static website developed with React on AWS is to use Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:

1. First, build your React application for production using a tool like npm run build or yarn build. This will generate a bundle of optimized static files that can be served to the client.

2. Next, create an S3 bucket and upload the static files to the bucket. Make sure to set the permissions on the bucket to allow public access to the files.

3. Configure the bucket to act as a static website by enabling the Static website hosting feature in the bucket properties. Specify the default index document and error document, if applicable.

4. Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the static files from the S3 bucket. CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations around the world, providing low-latency access to users from any location.

5. Finally, configure your domain name to point to the CloudFront distribution. This can be done by creating a CNAME record in your DNS settings that points to the CloudFront distribution domain name.
